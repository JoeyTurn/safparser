# safparser

This is a Python tool to extract information from SAF files (generated by expert-level MadAnalysis5 output SAF files) and displaying the histograms created from it using <code>matplotlib</code>.

Note: This is an up-to-date (as of 27.03.23) version of a SAF parser in Python. I took heavy inspiration of using <code>XML</code> as the base from Nicolas Detuschmann in his version of a SAF-parser https://github.com/ndeutschmann/saft with a few features specific to our own versions (though his does seem to be for Python 2.XX).

# Implementation

After either downloading the safparser.py file or copying the class onto your system, create a SAFParser object via <code>saf = SAFParser(path_to_saf_file)</code> where <code>path_to_saf_file</code> is where the SAF file is located. From there, to get the histograms out of the SAFParser object, simply use <code>saf.plot_saf()</code>. If you would like to see individually the data values (or other information from the SAF file), use saf.load_saf()[-1] (saf.load_saf()).

# Known Issues / Future Updates

Currently this only works and looks for the first signal region displayed within the SAF file, I will be working on updates to get the other signal regions soon. Cuts to the data are also unlikely to work as I have not done testing using data with cuts, though I'm sure that with time, I will eventually go down that path and will update the program as needed.
